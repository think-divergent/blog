When 10~20% of world's population need a therapist/coach just because of how their brain is wired;
when 17% of young adults need access to therapists for their mojor depressive episodes, 
building a global industry providing everyone a therapists can be very high growth, high impact and profitable short term. 

However, is it really a long term sustainable solution for humanity? 

Perhaps it's the society that needs therapy...

And who are most likely to change our society? 

The ones who are content with the status quo or the ones hardwired to be incompatible and feeling the friction every day?

The ones who perfectly follow the prescribed steps or the ones who believe irrepressibly there has to be an easier/better way?

The ones who excel at doing the same thing over and over again or the ones distractible enough to learn and explore all kind of random things?

The ones excel at living an average life is or ones impulsive enough to dedicate everything they have towards the slimmest chance to make the world a better place?

Yes, living life as one of them can be very challenging at times.

How do we let them choose to take the blue pill or red pill for it is the hard question, especially when blue pills are much more profitable to sell short term and kick in almost immediately

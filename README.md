## Building the Site Locally

You can make changes to the markdown files holding site content here on GitHub, but if you'd like to see your changes
locally before you submit, you can follow these steps.

1. Install [RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/basics) first
2. Once RVM is installed run `rvm use 2.5.0`
3. In the project directory, run `./run_server.sh`.
4. If you follow the link in jekyll's output(usually http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog), you'll be taken to a local version of the site with your changes
